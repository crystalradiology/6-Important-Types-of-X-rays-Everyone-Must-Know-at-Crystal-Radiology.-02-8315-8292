6 Important Types of X-rays, Everyone Must Know at Crystal Radiology. (02) 8315 8292


X-rays, also known as radiographs, are non-invasive medical imaging techniques that allow healthcare providers to see inside the body without surgery. By using a safe level of radiation, X-rays produce images of bones, tissues, and organs, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of injuries, diseases, and other health conditions. The versatility of X-rays makes them an essential tool in various medical fields. 
At Crystal Radiology, we use state-of-the-art X-ray technology to help diagnose a wide range of conditions. Here, we will explore six important types of X-rays, each serving a unique purpose in modern healthcare. 

1. Bone X-ray 
Purpose and Use: 
Bone X-rays are commonly used to evaluate injuries and conditions related to the bones. These X-rays provide clear images of the bones in different parts of the body, such as the arm, shoulder, spine, leg, and foot. They are essential for diagnosing: 
• Fractures: Bone X-rays are typically the first test used to identify fractures and assess their severity. 
• Dislocated Joints: They help determine the extent of joint dislocation and guide doctors in repositioning the joint. 
• Degenerative Bone Diseases: Conditions such as arthritis and osteoporosis can be diagnosed using bone X-rays, which reveal bone degradation over time. 
• Bone Infections and Tumors: These X-rays can identify signs of infection or abnormal growths within the bones. 
Bone X-rays are also helpful in planning orthopedic surgeries and locating foreign objects embedded near or around the bones. 
2. Dental X-ray 
Purpose and Use: 
Dental X-rays provide detailed internal images of the teeth, gums, and jaw. They are essential for diagnosing issues that may not be visible during a regular dental check-up, including: 
• Cavities: Dental X-rays help detect hidden cavities between teeth or under fillings. 
• Bone Loss and Decay: They reveal signs of bone loss in the jaw and any decay beneath existing fillings. 
• Infections and Abscesses: X-rays can identify underlying infections and abscesses that might be causing pain or swelling. 
• Impacted Teeth: These images help dentists assess the position of unerupted teeth and decide on orthodontic treatment. 
Dental X-rays are crucial for planning procedures such as root canals, dental implants, and post-surgery recovery. 
3. Abdominal X-ray 
Purpose and Use: 
Abdominal X-rays are used to capture images of internal organs like the stomach, liver, kidneys, and bladder. They are commonly used to diagnose: 
• Bladder and Kidney Stones: Abdominal X-rays can detect the size and location of stones in the urinary system. 
• Abdominal Pain: These X-rays help investigate causes of abdominal pain, such as bowel obstructions or intestinal perforations. 
• Swallowed Objects: When foreign objects are ingested, abdominal X-rays can pinpoint their location within the digestive tract. 
Specialized abdominal X-rays, such as those with contrast dyes (like barium enemas), provide more detailed images for gastrointestinal diagnoses. 
4. Chest X-ray 
Purpose and Use: 
Chest X-rays capture images of the lungs, heart, and chest bones (such as ribs and spine). They are one of the most frequently used imaging tests for diagnosing: 
• Lung Conditions: Chest X-rays help diagnose conditions like pneumonia, tuberculosis, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
• Heart Issues: They assess the size and shape of the heart to identify conditions such as heart failure or fluid buildup. 
• Rib Fractures: Chest X-rays detect fractures in the ribs, which may cause chest pain. 
They are typically used to evaluate respiratory symptoms like a persistent cough, chest pain, or difficulty breathing. 
5. Mammogram 
Purpose and Use: 
Mammograms are specialized X-rays used to examine breast tissue for early detection of breast cancer. They come in two forms: 
• Screening Mammogram: Used for preventive screening, this test detects early signs of breast cancer before any symptoms develop. 
• Diagnostic Mammogram: Performed when there are signs of breast abnormalities, such as lumps, pain, or nipple discharge, to investigate further. 
Mammograms play a key role in identifying breast cancer at its earliest stages, improving treatment outcomes. 
6. Angiogram 
Purpose and Use: 
An angiogram is an X-ray technique used to visualize blood vessels. It helps doctors evaluate blood flow and detect blockages or irregularities. Common uses include: 
• Blocked Blood Vessels: Angiograms identify blockages in arteries, which may require interventions like angioplasty. 
• Vascular Injuries: They detect issues like aneurysms, which are bulging blood vessels that pose serious risks. 
• Heart Conditions: Coronary angiograms examine the heart’s blood vessels to diagnose coronary artery disease. 
This test helps guide treatment for cardiovascular conditions and ensures proper blood flow throughout the body. 
How Do X-rays Work? 
X-rays work by sending a small dose of radiation through the body. Different tissues and structures absorb the radiation at different levels, which creates a contrast in the resulting image. 
•	Bones, which are dense and contain calcium, absorb more radiation and appear white on the X-ray. 
•	Soft tissues, such as organs, absorb less radiation and appear as varying shades of grey. 
•	Air-filled areas, like the lungs, absorb the least radiation and appear dark on the X-ray. 
•	This contrast allows doctors to assess the internal structure of the body accurately and make informed diagnostic decisions.
